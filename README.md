## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->

<!-- * You have read `<guide/link/documentation_related_to_project>`. -->

The project needs a server running Ubuntu 18.04 and above with Docker installed.
In the event you need to provision a new server, this project contains a `main.tf` file which can be used to provision a Linux instance on AWS.

## Setting up the project

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/alnwoks/arca-test.git
```
Once done, move into the `arca-test/` directory and run the initialization script:
